# Problem Statement

Internet users are growing exponentially for the last one decade .With rapid expansion of e-commerce, almost all the products are sold on the web. Customer gathers complete information about the products of their interest before making a purchase decision. Opinions and reviews placed by customers help the business as well as other customers in right decision making and improving shopping experience.

As the number of people writing reviews is growing rapidly, it becomes difficult to understand and track every customer needs. Some reviews are usefully too long, ambiguous, incomplete and short which makes it more time consuming and difficult to analyze for business. So Customer Feedback Analysis System is required to provide a solution to such problem which will keep track of all those reviews and present statistical report for enhancing the quality and performance of the product.

# Project Scope

The project focuses on mining and summarizing all the customer reviews of a product.
The reviews/feedback will be retrieved from different community sites (e-commerce sites) which would enable businesses to identity frequently reported issues and trends of the product. The project has its application that can be extended across various fields such as hotel industry, tourisms and travel industry, educational institutes etc. for decision making by businesses to expand customer base.

# Solution

The customer reviews in 'redmi6.csv' are extracted using python machine learning library 'BeautifulSoup'.The dataset contains around 200 plus reviews with 280 rows and 7 columns which is extracted from "www.amazon.com". Customer's sentiment analysis is done using various ML libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn etc. Classification  and  Prediction is done using Support Vector Machine (SVM).
