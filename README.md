# Problem Statement

Internet users are growing exponentially for the last one decade .With rapid expansion of e-commerce, almost all the products are sold on the web. Customer gathers complete information about the products of their interest before making a purchase decision. Opinions and reviews placed by customers help the business as well as other customers in right decision making and improving shopping experience.

As the number of people writing reviews is growing rapidly, it becomes difficult to understand and track every customer needs. Some reviews are usefully too long, ambiguous, incomplete and short which makes it more time consuming and difficult to analyze for business. So Customer Feedback Analysis System is required to provide a solution to such problem which will keep track of all those reviews and present statistical report for enhancing the quality and performance of the product.

# Project Scope

The project focuses on mining and summarizing all the customer reviews of a product.
The reviews/feedback will be retrieved from different community sites (e-commerce sites) which would enable businesses to identity frequently reported issues and trends of the product. The project has its application that can be extended across various fields such as hotel industry, tourisms and travel industry, educational institutes etc. for decision making by businesses to expand customer base.

# Solution

The customer reviews in 'redmi6.csv' are extracted using python machine learning library 'BeautifulSoup'.The dataset contains around 200 plus reviews with 280 rows and 7 columns which is extracted from "www.amazon.com". Customer's sentiment analysis is done using various ML libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn etc. Classification  and  Prediction is done using Support Vector Machine (SVM).

# Lexicon
 
The Lexicon file contains the list of all positive, negative and neutral words which are labelled as 1, -1, 0. It is used to calculate the score for positive, negative and neutral reviews. 


# Support Vector Machine

In machine learning, support vector machines (SVM) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyses data used for classification and regression analysis.
In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.

# Conclusion

The reviews received from the customers help business to make correct decision and to increase their profit. With the expansion of internet large amount of feedback/reviews can be received. “Customer Feedback Analysis ” will summarize all the reviews which will help product manufacturers to know customer opinion on different product features and help in improving the market strategy as per customer needs. 
It will help the support teams in identifying most frequent issues faced by customer, so that some customizations can be made to resolve them in quick time. The system will help business to maintain their market position and attract more customers.
